## Project Description

**Starry Jo** is a Neural Style Transfer project that applies the visual style of Vincent van Gogh's famous painting *Starry Night* to a content image using TensorFlow. The technique allows us to blend the content of one image with the artistic style of another, creating visually compelling results.

In this project, we use a pre-trained model from TensorFlow Hub to perform arbitrary image stylization. The model takes in a content image and a style image and generates a new image that retains the content of the original but is transformed with the texture, colors, and patterns of the style image.

### Example:
In this project, the content image is a personal photograph, while the style image is *Starry Night* by Vincent van Gogh. The result is a fusion of both, turning the photograph into a starry masterpiece!

## Technologies Used
- **TensorFlow**: Open-source library for machine learning and deep learning.
- **TensorFlow Hub**: A repository of reusable machine learning modules.
- **OpenCV**: Used for image processing and saving the output image.
- **NumPy**: For handling arrays and numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: For image visualization.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10
- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Hub
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install tensorflow tensorflow-hub opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

## How It Works

1. **Loading Images**: 
   The content and style images are loaded and pre-processed. The content image is the image you want to preserve structurally, while the style image defines the visual aesthetics.

2. **Applying Style Transfer**: 
   The pre-trained model from TensorFlow Hub is used to apply the style from the style image (Starry Night) to the content image. This results in a stylized image that maintains the key features of the content but is artistically transformed.

3. **Saving the Stylized Image**: 
   The stylized image is saved using OpenCV after being processed.

## Code Explanation

### Importing Libraries

```python
import tensorflow_hub as hub
import tensorflow as tf
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import cv2
```

### Loading the Pre-Trained Model

The model is loaded from TensorFlow Hub. This model can apply arbitrary styles to content images:

```python
model = hub.load('https://tfhub.dev/google/magenta/arbitrary-image-stylization-v1-256/2')
```

### Function to Load Images

We define a function `load_image` to load and preprocess images:

```python
def load_image(img_path):
    img = tf.io.read_file(img_path)
    img = tf.image.decode_image(img, channels=3)
    img = tf.image.convert_image_dtype(img, tf.float32)
    img = img[tf.newaxis, :]
    return img
```

### Loading Content and Style Images

```python
content_image = load_image('content2.jpg')
style_image = load_image('style2.jpg')
```

### Displaying Style Image

We can visualize the style image to verify that it's loaded correctly:

```python
plt.imshow(np.squeeze(style_image))
plt.show()
```

### Applying Style Transfer

The pre-trained model is used to apply the style to the content image:

```python
stylized_image = model(tf.constant(content_image), tf.constant(style_image))[0]
```

### Displaying the Stylized Image

We display the result of the style transfer:

```python
plt.imshow(np.squeeze(stylized_image))
plt.show()
```

### Saving the Generated Image

Finally, the stylized image is saved as a new file using OpenCV:

```python
cv2.imwrite('generated_img.jpg', cv2.cvtColor(np.squeeze(stylized_image)*255, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
```

## Files

- `content2.jpg`: The content image to which the style will be applied.
- `style2.jpg`: The style image (e.g., *Starry Night*).
- `generated_img.jpg`: The final output image generated by the model.
